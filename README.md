##Applicant
Name:  Yukiko Steineman

##Programming language
- Python 2.7.9

##Test environment
- Windows 8.1
- Run on Cygwin 64bit(Linux-like environment for windows)

##Overview 
- words_tweeted.py

Words are stored and counted in the 'index' dictionary object. This program calculates the maximum length of words 
and generates a dynamic amount of space between words and numbers. This is done, so that all the numbers line up vertically in the output file.

- median_unique.py

I considered this program would be executed periodically and the median would update during each run. The program creates/updates log.txt in the tweet_input folder, and records the total number of tweets and words. Next time the program runs, it reads log.txt file and re-calculates the median for only new tweets.
